* bulmaBook

FIXME: Write a one-line description of your library/project.

** Overview

As part of learning Bulma and to extend my Reagent knowledge, I'm implementing
the example used in the book [[https://jgthms.com/creating-interfaces-with-bulma-ebook/][Creating Interfaces with Bulma]]. The book walks
through the creation of a web application focusing on the use of Bulma to style
and mange the application layout. In this repository, I am attempting to
implement the example useing ClojureScript, Reagent and bulma. In many cases,
this involves defining new Reagent components which implement a working example
from the book. for example, a working ~navbar~ component, which uses bulma for
styling and Reagent + ClojureScript to make the menus work.

** Feedback

As I develop the components necessary to implement the book example, I will add
them to my Reagent+Bulma component library [[https://github.com/theophilusx/yorick][yorick]], which I hope to use for other
projects. Once stable, I hope to publish yorick to clojars. 

I'm very keen for feedback - especially ways to improve the components or more
idiomatic Clojure/ClojureScript use. Pull requests on either repository will be
welcome. 

** Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

:    clojure -A:fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

:    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

:    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build run:

#+begin_src shell
  rm -rf target/public
  clojure -A:fig:min
#+end_src
